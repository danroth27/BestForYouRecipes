Add sugar, a tablespoon at a time, beating after each addition. Continue until very stiff peaks form. Fold in nuts and vanilla. Lightly butter a metal 8-inch pie plate. (Do NOT use glass.) Spoon meringue into pan lightly, building up the edges to come at least 1\/2 inch above the side of the pan. Bake in preheated 300 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes until light brown. Cool completely before adding filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Melt chocolate and water in a pan over hot, but not boiling, water, stirring occasionally, to blend. Add vanilla and chocolate mixture (cooled) to whipped cream and pile into meringue shell, swirling top with spatula. Be sure to cool the chocolate mixture before adding to the whipped cream. If it is too warm, the mixture will thin out. If this happens, chill until it is thick enough to put in shell.",

Working in batches, drop butter slices into flour mixture and toss to coat; pick up each slice of butter and press between floured fingertips into flat, nickel-sized pieces.  Repeat until all butter is incorporated; toss to combine.  Freeze mixture (in bowl) until chilled, about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nSpray 24-square-inch work surface with nonstick cooking spray; spread spray evenly across surface with kitchen towel or paper towel.  Sprinkle 1\/3 cup of extra flour across sprayed area; gently spread flour across work surface with palm to form thin, even coating.  Add all but 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to flour mixture; stir briskly with fork until ball forms and no dry bits of flour are visible, adding remaining buttermilk as needed (dough will be sticky and shaggy but should clear sides of bowl).  With rubber spatula, transfer dough onto center of prepared work surface, dust surface lightly with flour, and, with floured hands, bring dough together into cohesive ball.\r\n\r\nPat dough into approximate 10-inch square; roll into 18- by 14-inch rectangle about 1\/4 inch thick, dusting dough and rolling pin with flour as needed.  Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, fold dough into thirds, brushing any excess flour from surface; lift short end of dough and fold in thirds again to form approximate 6- by 4-inch rectangle.  Rotate dough 90 degrees, dusting work surface underneath with flour; roll and fold dough again, dusting with flour as needed.\r\n\r\nRoll dough into 10-inch square about 1\/2 inch thick; flip dough and cut nine 3-inch rounds with floured biscuit cutter, dipping cutter back into flour after each cut.  Carefully invert and transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart.  Gather dough scraps into ball; roll and fold once or twice until scraps form smooth dough.  Roll dough into 1\/2-inch-thick round; cut 3 more 3-inch rounds and transfer to baking sheet.  Discard excess dough.\r\n\r\nBrush biscuit tops with melted butter.  Bake, without opening oven door, until tops are golden brown and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes.  Let cool on baking sheet 5 to 10 minutes before serving.",

Place on a plate, top with another plate, and place a weight on top (a 14-ounce can of vegetables works well). Let stand 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, cut the tofu into 1\/4-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the carrots, cabbage, red pepper, scallions, ginger, cilantro, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, egg, salt, and pepper. Lightly stir to combine.\r\n\r\nTo form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a damp cloth. Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water. Place 1\/2 rounded teaspoon of the tofu mixture in the center of the wrapper. Shape as desired. Set on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth. Repeat procedure until all of the filling is gone.\r\n\r\nUsing a steaming apparatus of your choice, bring 1\/4 to 1\/2-inch of water to a simmer over medium heat. Spray the steamer's surface lightly with the non-stick vegetable spray to prevent sticking. Place as many dumplings as will fit into a steamer, without touching each other. Cover and steam for 10 to 12 minutes over medium heat. Remove the dumplings from the steamer to a heatproof platter and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat until all dumplings are cooked.\r\n\r\nTo make dipping sauce, whisk together ingredients in a small bowl.",

Sift flour, granulated sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and 1 1\/2 teaspoons salt into the bowl of a mixer. Beat on low speed until just combined. Raise speed to medium and add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Divide batter among pans. Bake until cakes are set and a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool in pans set on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Turn out cakes onto racks and let cool completely.\r\n\r\n3. Make the caramel: Combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cook, without stirring, until mixture is dark amber, about 14 minutes. Remove from heat, and carefully pour in cream (mixture will bubble violently); stir until smooth. Return to heat, and cook until a candy thermometer reaches 238F, about 2 minutes. Pour caramel into a medium bowl, stir in 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Let cool completely.\r\n\r\n4. Meanwhile, make the frosting: whisk together cocoa and warm water in a bowl until cocoa dissolves. Beat butter, confections' sugar, and a generous pinch of coarse salt in a clean bowl with a mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in melted chocolate and then cocoa mixture until combined. Let stand for 30 minutes before using.\r\n\r\n5. Trim tops of cakes using a serrated knife to creat a level surface. Cut each in half horizontally to form 2 layers. Transfer 1 layer to a serving platter and spread 3\/4 cup caramel over top. Top with another cake layer, and repeat with remaining caramel and cake layers, leaving top uncovered. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\n6. Frost top and sides of cake in a swirling motion. Sprinkle with sea salt.\r\n\r\nMake ahead: Caramel can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before using. Cake layers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days (they actually taste better when refrigerated and have a better texture for stacking).\r\n\r\nStorage: Frosted cake can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.",

Dough may be scooped into balls, wrapped well, and frozen for up to several months. For hot homemade cookies, FAST, simply place frozen dough balls on a baking sheet, and bake for a minute or so longer than the directions indicate. These cookies stay nice and fresh for a day or so after baking. Freeze for longer storage. To make sure your oven temperature is exactly right, bake a sample cookie first. If the cookie spreads too much, raise the oven temperature slightly. If it doesn't spread enough, lower the oven temperature slightly, or pat the dough down slightly before baking.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Oil two large baking sheets, a bench scraper, and kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Lay a piece of parchment paper or a Silpat on the counter where the canes can dry. Move one of the baking sheets to the warm oven.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in a straight-sided deep saucepan off heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt and stir them together well. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pot and move it onto medium-high heat. Without stirring, let the syrup come up to 305 degrees. Using a pastry brush or a paint brush dedicated to culinary use, wash down any stray sugar crystals from the side of the pot. Ready the peppermint oil, food coloring, measuring spoons, and vegetable oil. Glove thyself with either heat-retardant gloves or snug mittens covered with disposable gloves.\r\n\r\nOnce the syrup has reached temperature, pour it out onto the room temperature baking sheet. Drizzle the peppermint oil on top, and using the bench scraper, scrape the hot candy up from the bottom and fold it over onto itself to stir it through. Once it has cooled slightly, mix in the vanilla as well. Note that the peppermint scent in the air will be strong.\r\n\r\nContinuously scrape up and stir the syrup to cool it until it becomes a pliable dough. Cut the dough in half and move one piece to the baking sheet inside the warm oven. (First, we\u2019ll \u201cpull\u201d the white half of the candy cane. Then we\u2019ll color the red half.)\r\n\r\nQuickly oil your gloved hands, as it\u2019s now time to pull the candy. Scrape up the candy dough into one piece and, working as quickly and as continuously as you can, pull it out into a rope, double it over onto itself, and twist it together. Pull it, double it, and twist it again. Keep on going this way at a quick clip, and you\u2019ll notice that the candy will start to take on a ribbon-y sheen. This is how the candy will turn white, so keep going until the color is pure. Embrace the upper body workout. Note that anytime the candy becomes too stiff, simply warm it up again in the oven to soften.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let the candy get too hard. When it\u2019s reached a nice white color, place it onto its baking sheet and move it to the warm oven. Re-oil your bench scraper. Take out the second tray of candy dough and pour on the red food coloring -- about a third of one of those tiny bottles for a good rich color. Use your scraper fold the candy onto itself to incorporate the color completely. Note that this side of the candy cane does not need to be pulled. Move both candy cane trays to the oven and let them warm through for about 5 minutes until pliant.\r\n\r\nOnce warm and squishy enough to work with, take both pieces of candy from the oven and roll them into logs as long as the baking sheet. Cut each log into four equal pieces. Hang on to one red piece and one white piece, moving the rest of the candy back into the oven to keep warm.\r\n\r\nOn the countertop, line the red and white logs alongside one another and begin to twist from one end, stretching as you go, making the candy canes as thin or as thick as you like. Use your oiled shears or knife to cut the length of each cane. Shape the hook of the cane, and press down on the ends to taper. Set the canes aside to cool. (Know, of course, that you could also cut into sticks, rounds, or individual peppermint sucking candy). Admire the individual quality of your handiwork.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process with the remaining 3\/4 of the candy, one piece of each color at a time.\r\n\r\nAllow candy to cool until completely hard; about 15 minutes. Wrap each cane in plastic wrap to keep it from sticking. Store in an airtight jar for several months.",
